# HSM Security Monitor 🛡️
**Next-Gen Hardware Security Module (HSM) Dashboard**

This project is a React-based security dashboard for monitoring physical and cryptographic threats to Hardware Security Modules. It features real-time tamper detection, quantum-safe simulation, and secure logging.

## 🚀 Features
- **Real-Time Monitoring**: Live status of HSM physical sensors (Door, Vibration, Temperature).
- **Quantum Threat Simulation**: Visual simulation of Grover's Algorithm attacks and system defensive response (Zeroization).
- **Secure Logging**: SHA-256 Hash Chain logging to ensure data integrity (Blockchain-ready).
- **OTP Authentication**: 2-Factor Authentication simulation for critical system access.
- **PWA Ready**: Installable on mobile devices for on-the-go monitoring.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Frontend**: React (Vite), TailwindCSS, Recharts
- **Backend**: Node.js, Express (Local JSON DB / Firebase Ready)
- **Hardware**: ESP32 Firmware for sensor integration

## 🔮 Roadmap
- [ ] Firebase Cloud Integration
- [ ] Blockchain Anchoring (Public Ledger)
- [ ] AI-Powered Threat Analysis
- [ ] Native Mobile App (React Native / Capacitor)
